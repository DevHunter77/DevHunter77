Yeah.
I'm DevHunter77, developer for the flight simulator geo-fs.com/geofs.php.
My current projects are the Robinson R44 and R22, McDonnell Douglas F4 Phantom, Cessna 208 Grand Caravan, and many more. 
I also do work for BuildTheEarth, a community dedicated to providing 3D scenery to GeoFS. Site available here: https://geofs3d.wixsite.com/buildtheearth
